<h2>Spreadsheet Tools</h2>
<br>

<h3>OpenRefine: <a href="http://openrefine.org/">openrefine.org</a></h3> 
<p>From the website: <em>OpenRefine (formerly Google Refine) is a powerful tool for working with messy data: cleaning it; transforming it from one format into another; extending it with web services; and linking it to databases like Freebase.</em></p>
<br>

<h3>RightField: <a href="http://www.rightfield.org.uk/">rightfield.org</a></h3>
<p>From the website: <em>RightField is an open-source tool for adding ontology term selection to Excel spreadsheets. RightField is used by a 'Template Creator' to create semantically aware Excel spreadsheet templates. The Excel templates are then reused by Scientists to collect and annotate their data; without any need to understand, or even be aware of, RightField or the ontologies used... RightField is a standalone Java application which uses Apache-POI for interacting with Microsoft documents. It enables users to import Excel spreadsheets, or generate new ones from scratch. </em></p>

<h3>CSV Fingerprint: <a href="http://setosa.io/csv-fingerprint/">web application</a> and <a href="http://setosa.io/blog/2014/08/03/csv-fingerprints/">blog post with more information</a/></h3>
<p>From <a href="http://acrl.ala.org/dh/2014/08/19/resource-csv-fingerprints/">ACRL blog dh+lib:</a> Victor Powell has released CSV Fingerprints, a tool for spotting errors in CSV files, such as instances “when the data itself has a comma in it.” As Powell describes, "The idea is to provide a birdseye view of the file without too much distracting detail. The idea is similar to Tufte’s Image Quilts…a qualitative view, as opposed to a rendering of the data in the file themselves. In this sense, the CSV Fingerprint is a sort of meta visualization." Users can use the <a href="http://setosa.io/csv-fingerprint/">browser-based software</a> or download the <a href="https://github.com/setosa/csv-fingerprint">source code from GitHub</a>.</p>
